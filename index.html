            Woodworth Cabinetry is a manufacturer offering kitchen and bath cabinetry to dealers. By 2021, the company decides to sell wood cabinetry for both end-users and dealers. The old website doesn‘t suit the need of presenting and selling goods to customers online and need a new functional and professional website.</p>
        <p class="p5">Project goals: </p>
            <div class="goals" style="width: 90rem;">
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">

        <div class="Research">

            <h1 class="title3">User Research</div>
                <p class="p6">The user research start with a proto-persona and several user interviews target in property owners with age 24-60. The interviews focus on their online shopping habit on cabinetry and practice with Ikea kitchen planner. I used affinity diagram and empathy map to analysis users’ pain point. It results with the following user persona.</p>

            <div class="image4"><img src="image/User journey map.png" width="960px"></div> 
            </div>

            <div class="Research2">

            <h1 class="title4">Market Research</div>

            <p class="p7">To gain inspiration for the new website, I began by identifying 6 competitors, I start with analysis 3 famous online retail brand (indirect competitors) Ikea, Wayfair and Structure. Then dig deeper with 4 cabinet companies (direct competitors) Woodmark, Cabintes.com, Fabuwood and Kcdus, they all sells good in the market.  My goal was to compare and identify common features across these sites and potential opportunities for Wood worth to differentiate itself.</p>
            <p class="p8">Two key purpose from this activity was learning how different websites organized the category of cabinet and compare the process of 3D Home planner for each company.  This was helpful information to design the processor punching and planning the 3D kitchen.</p>

                <h1 class="title5">Information Architecture</div>
    
                <p class="p9">After completing user and marketing research, I develop the navigation system by conducting a card sort, I organize all the tags into categories that seemed the most logical, then add titles that described each category. With the results of the card sort and inspiration from other competitor websites, I created a site map to define the overall site structure. I also create a system map to gain a better understanding of the functionality.</p>
